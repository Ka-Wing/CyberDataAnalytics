to process with stated in the report. <br />
* Feel free to ask us questions if you are running into small problems. Look for us at Slack. <br />

We have split the task into several tasks because one group decided to deduct points for readability of the code
due to code that was clustered together in one file. We have therefore decided to split the tasks to several files, but
it seems some systems fails to import local files.
